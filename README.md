# CHIP8-Emulator

Built a small (incomplete) CHIP8 Emulator using C++ . I referred to the documentation of CHIP8 and implemented a few opcodes. <br>
I have not implemented all, as it would've taken too long.<br>

I have tested it only with two opcodes:
6XKK - Loads value (KK) into register X
7XKK - Adds value (KK) into register x

The emulator as of now just prints register values. Project was just to strengthen my understanding so will not implement GUI and other opcodes.

Screenshots of the two opcodes in action:

Referred to CHIP8 documentation and some other articles online.
